# MaShop
Description:
This project is an android app which has e-commerce capabilities, 
The unique selling points of this app is the fact that it supports any small shops to have a chance to enter and experience e-commerce. 
The shop that wants to place their products or services on this app will need to register and login as a seller, 
then the app will prompt the seller to enter the details of the shop which include Name, Address, Location and type of products / service
which then the seller will have to agree to license and agreement that all the above information is true.
The seller must have an actual shop which shall be verified to prevent fraud.
The seller will have to manage the ways of delivery by themselves, it is 100% up to them 
*We will not provide ANY delivery services*.Almost like a Facebook page, the seller will a have an e-shop of its own
where he could place as many products as possible and customize the layout of their page freely the shop can choose to accept followers 
or no, if the shop accepts to have followers the buyers can follow their shop
(and similar to youtubeâ€™s subscribe to a channel feature) and whenever the shop adds or updates products the followers
will be notified. this is the details of a single so called e-shop (which is just a page for the seller to display their products) 
the app will have many e-shops (depending on how many sellers register) and these can be sorted by price, type of product, date etc. 
The app will also have the ability to search for either a specific product or a specific TYPE of product 
and if the customer searches for a specific type, the app will display all the e-shop with that type of products as a conclusion 
the app will have full searching and sorting abilities. At the end of the month/week/day (the seller can choose which they prefer)
the owner of the e-shop will have a summary of their revenue/profits and their selling history displayed. 
The user (customer/buyer) will also have to register and login and keep track of their buying history and a lot more.
